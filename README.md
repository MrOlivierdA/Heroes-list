## Objectives

- Use best JS practices
- Read documentation and test a REST API
- Use a REST API with HTTP requests
- Create a typical asynchronous flow : send asynchronous (promises or async/await) requests to a remote server and process the results
- DOM manipulation: changing the DOM based on results of HTTP requests

## The job

A Comics fan client would like to manage his favorites characters on a dashboard. He contacts you to create an app that will be able to view, edit, create all his favorites characters.

In this project, you will use the [**Character Database API**](https://character-database.becode.xyz/) to make/fetch a Character Manager. This project ask you to perform HTTP Request.

The root endpoint of the API is the following : https://character-database.becode.xyz/

This is a frontend project, you have to care about the appearance of your application and create a custom template.

### The features

#### Characters list page

This page will be the first one displayed when you open the app. Display the list of all the characters contained inside the database. You can use a table or a list of cards to display them, at your convenience.

Make sure the following features will be present for each character:

- Name
- A short description. Be aware that the `description` field is in Markdown and, of course, we want to display it as HTML in your application.
- An image. **Hint**: [Data URIs](https://css-tricks.com/data-uris/)
- A button to create a new character
- A way to open the corresponding Character

#### Single character

This page should display:

- The name and image for the character.
- A **full description** of the character. Be aware that the `description` field is in Markdown and, of course, we want to display it as HTML in your application.
- A way to open the Character editor
- A way to delete the character (You **must** add some kind of confirmation, like "Are you sure you want to delete this character ?")

#### Character creation

When we click on the character creation button in the Characters list page, we should get redirect to this page. This page should contain a form with an input for each of the following fields:

- `name`
- `shortDescription`
- `image` **Hint**: [Reading local files in JavaScript](https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/file/dndfiles/)
- `description` (You can just let the user enter Markdown but a Wysiwyg editor generating Markdown would be much cooler)

When the form is completed create the character in the API and redirect to the character list page.

#### Character editor

This part should be similar to the Character creation page except it allows to edit an existing character.  
It should also contain a button to delete the character. When this deleting an item, display a modal asking for confirmation.

#### Search input (optionnal)

The client can search a character by name or by ID.

## Constraints

- Your website must be deployed somewhere. We recommend [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) or [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com), two great (and free) solutions.
- You have to use the best practises in JS, as much as possible ðŸ‘‰ [Read these instructions](jsbestpractises.md)
- You must use Sass.

## Tips

### Bundler

To help you to compile your SCSS files and your modern JavaScript files, we advise you to use a bundler.

Two of the most easier to deal with are **Parcel.js** & **ViteJS**, have a look at the documentation of [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/docs/) or [ViteJS](https://vitejs.dev/guide/)

### .gitignore

If you use `npm`, don't forget to add `node_modules` in your `.gitignore` file before beginning.

### API REST

Explanations about what can do a [REST API](https://github.com/leny/klopedi/blob/master/rest/rest.md)

### CSS frameworks

You can use a _css frameworks_ like [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) or [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/).
It will help you to design quickly your application.

Even more, you can search and use some free pre-made templates like [this](https://github.com/startbootstrap/startbootstrap-heroic-features).

### HTTP requests

To help you to perfom HTTP Requests, use the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API).

An another nice solution is a tool called [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios). Axios is a promise based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js.
You can install it with npm :

```bash
npm install --save axios
```

Then to import it in your JS files:

```javascript
const axios = require("axios");
```

Using axios it is strongly recommended to use the [async/await](https://javascript.info/async-await) syntax when working with asynchronous operations.

### Postman

To test APIs rapidly before coding you can use [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/).
To start using it today with the Character Database API you can **import** [this Postman collection](https://static.becode.xyz/character-database/characters-database.postman_collection.json).

You can follow this serie of video to know how to manage it : [Postman Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juldrxDrSH0&list=PLhW3qG5bs-L-oT0GenwPLcJAPD_SiFK3C&ab_channel=AutomationStepbyStep-RaghavPal)

## Good luck for this project and show us your favorite serie/movie/game characters!
